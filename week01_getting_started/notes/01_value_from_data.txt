--Getting Value out of Data

-actionable information: historical data + near real-time data = prediction
ex:
  prediction - today's forecast is cold and tomorrow's forecast calls for information
  action - wear a jacket today and tomorrow carry an umbrella

--reasons for sudden interest in data science?
• big data - we now have the ability to gather massive amounts of info from user of consumer technologies
• computation is scalable and major operations can be performed with that data

--how much data is big data?
1000 MEGABYTES = 1GB
1000 GIGABYTES = 1TB
1000 TERABYTES = 1PB
1000 PETABYTES = 1EB
1000 EXABYTES = 1 ZETTABYTE

-prediction of growth of data being used.
in 2009 0.8 Zb was in use, forecasting shows by 2020 35.2 Zb will be in use. in 11 years thats growth of a factor of 44.

--Why Python for Data science

• List traits of modern data scientists
  - have a passion for data
  - relate problems to analytics
  - care about engineering solutions
  - exhibit curiosity
  - communicate with teammates

• Explain why Python is a good programming language for data science
  - easy to read and learn
  - vibrant community
  - growing and evolving set of libraries
    * data management
    * analytical processing
    * visualization
  - applicable to steps in data science process
  - notebooks

• Recite four major Python modules that are useful for data analysis
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - jupyter notebooks
  - matplotlib

--Case Study: Soccer Data Analysis

• talk about the "big picture" of data science through soccer case Study
  - ask oneself: what insights do i expect to gain from this?
  - for this scenario, a better understanding and insights on:
      • player strengths
      • enhancing performance
      • critical attributes for a player's performance
  - actions that can then be taken are the design of programs to improve weak areas

*** Basic Steps in a Data Science Project ***
  • Acquire - import raw dataset into your analytics platform
  • Prepare - explore and visualize, perform data cleaning
  • Analyze - feature selection, model selection, analyze the results
  • Report - present findings
  • Act - use findings to implement processes

• generate stats about a soccer data scientists

• summarize how data cleaning and correlations were applied to an existing dataset

• recite the data visualization techniques employed in the study

• explain how clustering similar groups and plotting clusters helped the case study

• recall what was used to draw conclusion based on data analysis
