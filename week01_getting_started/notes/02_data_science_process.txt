  - Step 1: Acquire Data
    ° Identify data sets
    ° Retrieve data
    ° Query data
  - Step 2: Prepare Data
    ° Explore
      * understand nature of data
      * preliminary analysis
    ° Pre-process
      * clean
      * integrate
      * package
  - Step 3: Analyze Data
    ° Select analytical techniques
    ° Build models
  - Step 4: Report (communicate results)
    ° can include visualizations
    ° generate reports of findings and explanations
  - Step 5: Act
    ° apply results
  - Iterative Process
    ° re-run different steps as needed

• Understand what each step involves


--Step 1: Acquiring Data--
[GOALS]
• List techniques and technologies to access and retrieve the data needed
  ° traditional relational databases using structured query languages (SQL)
  ° text files and spreadsheets using scripting languages like python, r, scala
  ° remote data via the internet stored in JSON or XML using web services like SOAP, REST, and WebSocket APIs
  ° NoSQL storage like MongoDB via APIs or other web services

• Describe an example scenario that accesses data from a variety of sources using different technologies
  ° wildfire prediction
    - Historical weather data via relational database
    - Current weather via WebSockets for real-time conditions
    - Real-time tweets/social media posts retireved via REST APIs

{Where's the data?}
• Identify suitable data
• Acquire all available data


--Step 2: Exploring Data---
[GOALS]
• Explain the importance of exploring data
  - need to understand general characteristics of data collected so it may be used effectively
    ° correlations
      * correlation graphs - explore dependancies of variables in data
    ° general trends
      * general trend graphs - show how data is progressing over time
    ° outliers
      * outlier graphs - show distance of data points from other points which can help for errors or find rare events

• Identify methods to perform preliminary analysis of data
  - Summary statistics provide numerical formats to describe data
    ° mean - location of specific value, average value in dataset
    ° median - location of specific value, middle value in dataset
    ° mode - value that occurs most frequently in a dataset
    ° range/standard deviation - measures of spread in data

  - Visualization of Data
    ° Heat Maps - quick visualization of intensity over an area
    ° Histograms - show distribution of data
    ° Boxplots - also show data distribution
    ° Line graphs - useful for seeing how values change over time
    ° Scatter plots - show correlation between two variables

[Takeaway] exploring data gives a better understanding of the complexity of the data collected and help guide the rest of the process

--Step 2B: Pre-processing Data--
[GOALS]
• Identify problems with real-world data
  - Inconsistent values
  - Duplicate records
  - Missing values
  - Invalid data
  - Outliers

• Describe what is needed to transform raw data into data that can be used for analysis
  - Cleaning Data
    ° Remove data with missing values
    ° Merge duplicate records
    ° Generate best estimate for invalid values
    ° Remove outliers
    ° Successfully handling data corrections requires domain knowledge

  - Shaping Data
    ° Data Munging
      · Dimensionality Reduction: when dataset has a large number of dimensions choosing those most applicable
      · Data Manipulation: formatting and classifying raw data to usable types
      · Transformation: used to reduce noise and variability, like aggregation
      · Feature Selection: removing redundant features, combining features, or adding features
      · Scaling: changing range of values to avoid large values from dominating results unfairly


--Step 3: Analyze Data--
[GOALS]
• Describe what is involved in applying an analysis technique to data
  - Build Model
    ° Input Data -> Analysis Technique -> Model -> Model Output
  - Steps in modeling
    1. Select technique
    2. Build model
    3. Validate model
  - Evaluation of Results
    ° Classification and Regression: Predicted Value vs. Correct Value
    ° Clustering: Do the groups make sense given the sample, are they helpful?
    ° Association Analysis and Graph Analytics: Investigate -> Validate, did your prediction actually occur
  - Determine Next Steps
    ° Repeat Analysis?
    ° Take a deeper look? Add more variables?
    ° Act on results?

• List three basic analysis techniques
  - Classification: goal is to predict category of input data, ex. tumor is either malignant or benign
  - Regression: goal is to predict numeric value, ex. predict price of stock over time
  - Clustering: organize similar items into groups, ex. organizing customer base in groups like adults/seniors/teens
  - Association Analysis: find rules to capture associations between items, ex. a user with product X is likely to also use product Y
  - Graph Analytics: use graph structures to find connections between entities, ex. exploring spread of disease, optimization of data network


--Step 4: Reporting Insights--
[GOALS]
• Determine what to present in reporting your findings
  - "What is my punchline?": what are the main results
  - "What value do these results provide?"
  - "How can this model add to the application?"
  - Answers to these questions need to be included in the report
  - Not all results may be positive or skew with what is desired but if true still need to be included

• Identify techniques to communicate your results
  - Visualizations
  - Data tables

--Step 5: Turning Insights into Action--
[GOALS]
• Explain what turning insights into action means

• Connect your results with your business question
