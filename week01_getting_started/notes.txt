--actionable information: historical data + near real-time data = prediction
ex:
  prediction - today's forecast is cold and tomorrow's forecast calls for information
  action - wear a jacket today and tomorrow carry an umbrella

--reasons for sudden interest in data science?
• big data - we now have the ability to gather massive amounts of info from user of consumer technologies
• computation is scalable and major operations can be performed with that data

--how much data is big data?
1000 MEGABYTES = 1GB
1000 GIGABYTES = 1TB
1000 TERABYTES = 1PB
1000 PETABYTES = 1EB
1000 EXABYTES = 1 ZETTABYTE

--prediction of growth of data being used.
in 2009 0.8 Zb was in use, forecasting shows by 2020 35.2 Zb will be in use. in 11 years thats growth of a factor of 44.
